# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows a user to play against the computer by selecting one of the three choices: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer randomly generates its choice, and the game determines the winner based on the standard rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beat Paper
Paper beats Rock

The game keeps track of the user's and computer's scores and displays messages indicating the outcome of each round. The user can continue playing by clicking on their choice, and the scores are updated accordingly.

Features:
Interactive UI with clickable choices for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
Random computer choice generation.
Score tracking for both the user and the computer.
Display of game results and messages indicating the winner of each round.

How to Play:
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click on one of the choices (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
The game will display the result of the round and update the scores.
Continue playing by clicking on your choice again.

Files:
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the game.
app.js: The JavaScript file containing the game logic and interactivity.
